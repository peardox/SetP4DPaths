How to use the above. 
Compile it then Run it

Select the directory that contains all the P4D stuff (i.e. a directory containing the repos for python4delphi, PythonEnviroments, Lightweight-Python-Wrappers, P4D-Data-Sciences and PythonPackages4Delphi). 

Select your Delphi version (if you have more than one make sure the right one is selected) then click "Set Paths"

It'll go and set all the paths correctly including some I've recently discovered
